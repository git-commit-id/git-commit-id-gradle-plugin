# git-commit-id-gradle-plugin
Gradle plugin which includes build-time git repository information into an POJO / *.properties). Make your apps tell you which version exactly they were built from! Priceless in large distributed deployments... :-)

# Compatibility Matrix
This project requires at least 11 java and will rely on gradle's convention for configuration

With [Gradle's Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html) the
minimum supported gradle version is 5.0.
Unfortunately conventions only had been introduced with [gradle 5.1](https://docs.gradle.org/5.1/release-notes.html)
so that is as of now the minimal supported version.
